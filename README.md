# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-ResNet
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning system that identifies and classifies facial emotions from grayscale images into seven predefined categories. This project leverages transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet model to achieve accurate and efficient emotion recognition.
